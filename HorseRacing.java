     * in order for the tracks to move to the end
     * create a random int with max of 1, there can be only 2 options 0 or 1
     * if the random integer hits a 1 that object would switch places with -
     * do a while loop for the track to happen
     * the first track that reaches to " "
     * record that track and send it to the other method
