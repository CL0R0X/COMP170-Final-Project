    blackjack() {
    blackjack is, as the name implies, the card game blackjack. The user will be presented with the current sum of their
    cards, and if the sum goes past 21, they lose. If they hit 21 exactly or have a number closer to 21 then the dealer, they win.
    Super compressed code would be something like:
        (card values defined and stored)
        Ask for user's bet out of their current balance.
        Deal out two of these cards randomly using a new Random.

        User chooses whether to draw another random card based on their current sum.
        if (sum > 21) {
            user loses.
        }
        Code above will loop until user decides to stop or 5 turns have been ran through.
        After loop, compare with dealer's hand.
        if (dealerHand < userhand) {
             user wins.
             Multiply bet by x amount (yet to be determined) and add it to balance)
        else if (dealerHand = userHand) {
             user and dealer draw.
        else if (dealerHand > userHand) {
             user loses.
             Deduct bet from balance.
        }
        Prompt user to see if they want to play again (show their new balance as well with their wins/losses.
        if (yes) {
            restart program.
        else if (no) {
            printHome();
        }
    */
